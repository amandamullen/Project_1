# Elk Stack
# Automated Elk Stack Deployment

 The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.   
    
  !  
    
    These files have been tested and used to generate a live Elk Stack deployment on Azure. The files can be used to recreate the
    entire Elk Stack or just portions of the playbook file can be used to install files such as filebeat.

This document contains the following information:
 - Description of the Topology 
 - Access Policies
 - ELK Configuration
 - Beats in Use
 - Machines Being Monitored
 - How to Use the Ansible Build
 
***Description of the Topology
 
 -There are two types of network topologies: physical and logical. Physical topology emphasizes the physical layout of the connected devices and nodes, while the logical topology focuses on the pattern of data transfer between network nodes.
The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn vulnerable Web Application.
Regardless of whether it’s hardware or software, or what algorithm(s) it uses, a load balancer disburses traffic to different web servers in the
resource pool to ensure that no single server becomes overworked and subsequently unreliable. Load balancers effectively minimize server response 
time and maximize throughput.

What is the advantage of a jump box?
- A jump box is a secure computer that all admins first connect to before launching any administrative task or use as an origination point to connect to other servers or untrusted environments.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the **filesystem** and system **resources / availability**.
- What does Filebeat watch for? **log files and filesystem changes**

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
-note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.


| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.0.0.7   |20.124.228.102 Linux 
| Web-1    | DVWA     | 10.0.0.4   |Linux            |
| Web-2    | DVWA     | 10.0.0.8   |Linux            |
| ELK-VM   | ELK Server | 10.1.0.4 |20.110.0.90 Linux

***Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 


Only the **JumpBox** machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- **My home network public IP address (20.124.228.102)*
Machines within the network can only be accessed by SSH.

- Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? What was its IP address? JumpBox VM, its private Ip address(Vnet IP)-10.0.0.7

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes (SSH)           | SSH:My home network  |
| Web-1    | Yes (HTTP)          | HTTP:any, SSH:10.0.0.7   |
| Web-2    | Yes (HTTP)          | HTTP:any, SSH:10.0.0.7   |
| Web-3    | Yes (HTTP)          | HTTP:any, SSH:10.0.0.7   |
| ELK-VM   | Yes (HTTP, SSH)     | HTTP:any, SSH:10.0.0.7   |

*** Elk Configuration
Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is an advantage because...
-It's a free open-source tool.
- Easy to use and set up: No special coding skills are necessary to use Ansible’s playbooks.
- Powerful: Ansible lets you model even highly complex IT workflows. 
- Flexible: You can orchestrate and customize an entire application environment no matter where it’s deployed.
- Agentless: You will not need to install any other software, firewall ports or seperate management structures on the client systems you want to automate.
- Efficient: Because there is no extra software installed, there is more room for application resources on your server.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Install docker.io
- Install pip3
- Install Docker python module
- Downloads abd configures Elk Docker container
- Increase virtual memory
- Download and launch a docker
- Activates ports 5601, 9200, and 5044.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
